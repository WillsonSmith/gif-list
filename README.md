# `gif-list`

`gif-list` is a website I built to pull results repository of reaction gifs [gifs project](https://github.com/willsonsmith/gifs). It is built using my [`gif-player`](https://github.com/WillsonSmith/gif-player-component) web component. The site is built with (Vite)[https://vitejs.dev/] running on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
